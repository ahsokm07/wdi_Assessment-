The below code uses the Ruby version Manager (rvm) binaries from the agent/master to execute the puppet commands.  I have used a scripted pipeline mode below using single node executor once the code is verified and validated it will be pushed to deploy. 



node {
	checkout scm
	echo "intitating pipeline"

	stage 'testing sytax of the module"
	sh ''#!/bin/bash
	source ~/rvm/scripts/rvm
	exec puppet parser validate manifests/tomcat/
	...
	
	stage 'lint testing'
	sh ' ' ' #!/bin/bash
	source ~/rvm/scripts/rvm
	exec puupet-lint manifests/*.pp
	...
	
	 stage 'smoke testing'
	sh ' ' ' #~/bin/bash
	source ~/rvm/scripts/rvm
	exec puppet apply test/init.pp --noop --modulepath=/module/tomcat/init.pp

	stage 'deploy'
  	echo 'deploy to puppet masters'
}
